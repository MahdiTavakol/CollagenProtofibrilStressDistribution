# CollagenProtofibrilStressDistribution
The main bash script calculates the protofibril stress distributions from simulation trajectories in various subdirectories. 
It is hypothesized that the simulation trajectory for each simulation is under the "dump" folder. 
Modify the "Sims" variable in the "Driver.sh" to include the name of your simulations. 
The protofibril ids are asigned based on their radius.. Thus, it is possible that in two snapshots different protofibrils are asigned the same 
id. Be careful!
